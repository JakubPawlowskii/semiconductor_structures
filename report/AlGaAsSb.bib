abstract = {GaAIAsSb quaternary alloys and GaAISb ternary alloys have been grown by liquid phase epitaxy (LPE) at 550°C and 450°C, respectively. The material compositions and epitaxial structures are suitable for fabricating photodiodes sensitive in the 1.0-1.8 $\mu$m wavelength range. Various avalanche photodiode structures fabricated in these materials are discussed. The ion implanted GaAIAsSb APD's exhibit a high gain of 100, 82 percent quantum efficiency, and a FWHM of 400 ps. The heterojunction GaAIAsSb APD's have a gain of 40, 92 percent quantum efficiency, and a FWTM of 150 ps. The only remaining material problem which limits the performance of these devices is the high-surface leakage current. {\textcopyright} 1981 IEEE},

abstract = {A method is described for calculation of the optical constants (the refractive index, extinction coefficient, and absorption coefficient) of some III-V binaries (GaP, GaAs, GaSb, InP, InAs, and InSb), ternaries (Al xGa1-xAs), and quaternaries (In1-xGa xAsyP1-y) in the entire range of photon energies (0-6.0 eV). The imaginary part of the dielectric function [$\epsilon$2($\omega$)] is derived first from the joint density-of-states functions at energies of various critical points (CPs) in the Brillouin zone; then its real part [$\epsilon$1($\omega$)] is obtained analytically using the Kramers-Kronig relation. The indirect band-gap transitions are also assumed to provide a gradually increasing $\epsilon$2 spectrum expressed by a power law of (ℏ$\omega$-EIDg)2, where ℏ$\omega$ is the photon energy and EIDg is the indirect band-gap energy. The optical dispersion relations are expressed in terms of these model dielectric functions. The present model reveals distinct structures in the optical constants at energies of the E0, E 0+$\Delta$0 [three-dimensional (3-D) M0 CP], E1, E1+$\Delta$1 [3-D M1 or two-dimensional (2-D) M0 CP], and E2 or E'0 (triplet) (damped harmonic oscillator). Excellent agreement is achieved between our calculations and published experimental data for these semiconductors over a wide range of the photon energies.},

abstract = {III–V ternary and quaternary alloy systems are potentially of great importance for many high-speed electronic and optoelectronic devices, because they provide a natural means of tuning the magnitude of forbidden gaps so as to optimize and widen the applications of such semiconductor devices. Literature on the fundamental properties of these material systems is growing rapidly. Even though the basic semiconductor alloy concepts are understood at this time, some practical and device parameters in these material systems have been hampered by a lack of definite knowledge of many material parameters and properties. This chapter attempts to summarize, in graphical and tabular forms, most of the important theoretical and experimental data on the III–V ternary and quaternary alloy parameters and properties. They can be classified into six groups: 1.Structural parameters2.Mechanical, elastic, and lattice vibronic properties3.Thermal properties4.Energy band parameters5.Optical properties6.Carrier transport properties. The III–V ternary and quaternary alloys considered here are those of Group III (Al, Ga, In) and V (N, P, As, Sb) atoms. The model used in some cases is based on an interpolation scheme and, therefore, requires that data on the material parameters for the related binaries (AlN, AlP, GaN, GaP, etc.) are known. These data have been taken mainly from the Landolt-B{\"{o}}rnstein collection, Vol. III/41, and from the Handbook on Physical Properties of Semiconductors Volume 2: III–V Compound Semiconductors, published by Springer in 2004. The material parameters and properties derived here are used with wide success to obtain the general properties of these alloy semiconductors.},

abstract = {The AlxGa1-xAs/GaAs heterostructure system is potentially useful material for high-speed digital, high-frequency microwave, and electro-optic device applications. Even though the basic Al xGa1-xAs/GaAs heterostructure concepts are understood at this time, some practical device parameters in this system have been hampered by a lack of definite knowledge of many material parameters. Recently, Blakemore has presented numerical and graphical information about many of the physical and electronic properties of GaAs [J. S. Blakemore, J. Appl. Phys. 53, R123 (1982)]. The purpose of this review is (i) to obtain and clarify all the various material parameters of AlxGa1-xAs alloy from a systematic point of view, and (ii) to present key properties of the material parameters for a variety of research works and device applications. A complete set of material parameters are considered in this review for GaAs, AlAs, and Al xGa1-xAs alloys. The model used is based on an interpolation scheme and, therefore, necessitates known values of the parameters for the related binaries (GaAs and AlAs). The material parameters and properties considered in the present review can be classified into sixteen groups: (1) lattice constant and crystal density, (2) melting point, (3) thermal expansion coefficient, (4) lattice dynamic properties, (5) lattice thermal properties, (6) electronic-band structure, (7) external perturbation effects on the band-gap energy, (8) effective mass, (9) deformation potential, (10) static and high-frequency dielectric constants, (11) magnetic susceptibility, (12) piezoelectric constant, (13) Fr{\"{o}}hlich coupling parameter, (14) electron transport properties, (15) optical properties, and (16) photoelastic properties. Of particular interest is the deviation of material parameters from linearity with respect to the AlAs mole fraction x. Some material parameters, such as lattice constant, crystal density, thermal expansion coefficient, dielectric constant, and elastic constant, obey Vegard's rule well. Other parameters, e.g., electronic-band energy, lattice vibration (phonon) energy, Debye temperature, and impurity ionization energy, exhibit quadratic dependence upon the AlAs mole fraction. However, some kinds of the material parameters, e.g., lattice thermal conductivity, exhibit very strong nonlinearity with respect to x, which arises from the effects of alloy disorder. It is found that the present model provides generally acceptable parameters in good agreement with the existing experimental data. A detailed discussion is also given of the acceptability of such interpolated parameters from an aspect of solid-state physics. Key properties of the material parameters for use in research work and a variety of Al xGa1-xAs/GaAs device applications are also discussed in detail.},

With p-i-n diodes we have measured the impact ionization coefficients $\alpha$ (electrons) and $\beta$ (holes) with different composition and temperature, A resonant enhancement of the hole ionization coefficient is found for x =0.065 (300 K) where the ratio $\beta$/$\alpha$ exceeds values of 20. This effect is attributed to impact ionization initiated by holes from the split-off valence band; if the spin orbit splitting A is equal to the bandgap energy Eg, the threshold energy for hole initiated impact ionization reaches the smallest possible value {\{}Ei=Eg) and the ionization process occurs with zero momentum. This leads to a strong increase of 0 at $\Delta$/Eg =1.

A deviation of Be doping concentration in our AlAsSb field control layer leads higher than intended electric fields in the InGaAs absorption layer and the InAlAs field control layer. Calculation of avalanche gain suggests that the gain in the InGaAs is low and therefore the gain and excess noise characteristics are dominated by impact ionization in the InAlAs field control layer and the AlAsSb multiplication layer. Despite this low excess noise factors corresponding to an effective electron to hole ionization coefficient ratio between 0.1 to 0.15, were measured.

abstract = {Coherent infrared radiation has been observed from forward biased GaAs p-n junctions. Evidence for this behavior is based upon the sharply beamed radiation pattern of the emitted light, upon the observation of a threshold current beyond which the intensity of the beam increases abruptly, and upon the pronounced narrowing of the spectral distribution of this beam beyond threshold. The stimulated emission is believed to occur as the result of transitions between states of equal wave number in the conduction and valence bands. Several requirements must be fulfilled' in order that such stimulated emission can be observed: (a) The electron and hole populations within the active region must be large enough that their quasi-Fermi levels are separated by an energy greater than that of the radiation; (b) losses due to absorption by other processes must be small relative to the gain produced by stimulated emission; and (c) the active region must be contained within a cavity having a resonance which falls in the spectral range within which stimulated emission is possible. In our structure, the necessary population inversion is produced by injection of carriers from the degenerate n-and p-type end regions of the junction into the transition region. Condition (b) is the most difficult to fulfill, since the stimulated radiation propagates in the plane of the junction where the active region may be only a fraction of a wavelength in thickness and has a wave front which laterally extends many wavelengths into the passive n-and p-type regions bounding the junction plane. Laser action is favored by the large matrix element for band-to-band radiative recombination compared with that for free carrier absorption in GaAs and by the fact that the energy of the emitted radiation is below the absorption threshold of the degenerate material bounding the junction. The diodes can be described approximately as cubes 0.4 mm on an edge, the junction lying in a horizontal plane through the center. Current is passed through the junction by means of Ohmic contacts attached to the top and bottom faces. The front and back faces are polished parallel to each other and perpendicular to the plane of the junction, in order to satisfy condition (c) above. Current is applied in the form of pulses of 5 to 20 p. sec duration with the diode immersed in liquid nitrogen. FIG. 1. Radiation patterns observed with image tube a distance d from junction. (a) and (b), diode L-69 below and above threshold, d = 6 cm. (c) Diode L-69 above threshold, d = 15 cm. (d) Diode L-75, d = 5 cm. We have studied the radiation pattern by means of an infrared converter tube which provides an image that can be examined visually or photographically. Examples of such patterns are given in Fig. 1. The first two photographs show the pattern produced by a diode with the current below and above threshold, with the image converter 6 cm from the diode. Figure 1(c) shows the same diode above threshold with the screen 15 cm away, so that the radiation pattern is correspondingly enlarged. In these photographs the horizontal bands result from interference between the light produced at the junction and its image in the metal disc on which the diode was mounted, and their presence does not imply coherence of the source. On the other hand, the vertical bands which appear only in Figs. 1(b) and 1(c) are due to interference between the waves emitted at various points along the edge of the junction at the front face of the cube, and their appearance is evidence that a definite phase relation exists between the light emitted at various points along the junction, i.e. , that the light is coherent. The angular separation between the interference maxima is consistent with the dimensions of the junction and the wavelength},

@article{Dutta1997,
abstract = {Recent advances in nonsilica fiber technology have prompted the development of suitable materials for devices operating beyond 1.55 $\mu$m. The III-V ternaries and quaternaries (AlGaIn)(AsSb) lattice matched to GaSb seem to be the obvious choice and have turned out to be promising candidates for high speed electronic and long wavelength photonic devices. Consequently, there has been tremendous upthrust in research activities of GaSb-based systems. As a matter of fact, this compound has proved to be an interesting material for both basic and applied research. At present, GaSb technology is in its infancy and considerable research has to be carried out before it can be employed for large scale device fabrication. This article presents an up to date comprehensive account of research carried out hitherto. It explores in detail the material aspects of GaSb starting from crystal growth in bulk and epitaxial form, post growth material processing to device feasibility. An overview of the lattice, electronic, transport, optical and device related properties is presented. Some of the current areas of research and development have been critically reviewed and their significance for both understanding the basic physics as well as for device applications are addressed. These include the role of defects and impurities on the structural, optical and electrical properties of the material, various techniques employed for surface and bulk defect passivation and their effect on the device characteristics, development of novel device structures, etc. Several avenues where further work is required in order to upgrade this III-V compound for optoelectronic devices are listed. It is concluded that the present day knowledge in this material system is sufficient to understand the basic properties and what should be more vigorously pursued is their implementation for device fabrication. {\textcopyright} 1997 American Institute of Physics.},

Here we demonstrate and analyze superluminescent diodes with output centered at 2.4 $\mu$m (range ∼2.2-2.5 $\mu$m) from GaInAsSb/AlGaAsSb quantum wells in a separate confinement structure. Pulsed wave output of 1 mW (38 kW cm2 Sr-1) is achieved at room temperature for 40 $\mu$m × 2 mm devices. Superluminescence is evidenced in superlinear increase in emission, spectral narrowing, and angular narrowing of light output with increasing current injection. Optical output is analyzed and modeled with rate equations. Potential routes for future improvements are explored, such as additional Auger suppression and photonic mode engineering.},

abstract = {We have realized GaAs/AlAs quantum-cascade lasers operating at 4.75 THz exhibiting more than three times higher wall plug efficiencies than GaAs/Al0.25Ga0.75As lasers with an almost identical design. At the same time, the threshold current density at 10 K is reduced from about 350 A/cm2 for the GaAs/Al0.25Ga0.75As laser to about 120 A/cm2 for the GaAs/AlAs laser. Substituting AlAs for Al0.25Ga0.75As barriers leads to a larger energy separation between the subbands reducing the probability for leakage currents through parasitic states and for reabsorption of the laser light. The higher barriers allow for a shift of the quasi-continuum of states to much higher energies. The use of a binary barrier material may also reduce detrimental effects due to the expected composition fluctuations in ternary alloys.},

abstract = {Gallium antimonide (GaSb) which is a narrow band gap compound semiconductor has received attention because of its potential applications in optoelectronic devices. In the present work, p-type GaSb wafers of 〈1 0 0〉 orientation were irradiated with 70 MeV 56Fe ions at fluences varying from 1 × 1012 to 1 × 1014 ions cm -2. Mid-infrared and Far-infrared Fourier Transform (FT) measurements were carried out to investigate the optical properties of as irradiated and vacuum annealed samples. Mid-infrared Fourier Transform study revealed that the optical absorption of the irradiated samples increases with increasing ion fluence due to increase in irradiation-induced defects. The band gap energy determined from the infrared spectra was found to change from 0.65 to 0.62 eV while for non-irradiated GaSb wafer the corresponding estimate was 0.67 eV. The density of the carrier estimated from the plasma frequency ($\omega$p) was found to vary from 2.05 × 1018 to 1.9 × 10 18 cm-3. The samples annealed in vacuum (10-6 mb) over the temperature range 100-600 °C showed the significant damage recovery. Crown Copyright {\textcopyright} 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V.
