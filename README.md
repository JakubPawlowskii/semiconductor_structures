# Semiconductor Structures
Code for calculations of various parameters of semiconductor structures, such as band gap,
valence band offset etc.
Quaternary alloy of choice is AlGaAsSb on GaAs substrate. Developed for 
Semiconductor Structure course at WUST.

Code should work out of the box in PyCharm on Windows 10, with Python 3.8.8.
